Even though it wasn't part of any reviews I chose to do a quite big rewrite to remove classes that didn't really provide any real value. While doing so I also implemented some of the suggestions.

1. Separate the ConsoleUI into two classes.
2. Fixing a bug while adding a new boat.

I was asked to add more comments but since they also said the code was easy enough to follow without them and didn't provide any real reason other than code should have comments I chose to not add any extra comments except for methods that I thought might be misunderstood.
